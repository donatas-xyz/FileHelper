A junior developer was tasked with creating a class to read and write text files. The class is being used in production by production code.

Your task is to fix up the FileHelper class to production standards.

1) Use the _For_Annotation file to provide a commentary on the existing implementation. Please describe what it is for and what it is doing, and then use inline comments 
to perform a (sane) code review.

2) Improve the implementation to "production" standards, but without over-engineering. You can use any additional classes, .NET libraries and test frameworks, but the dependent 
production code must still compile against the new implementation (i.e. do not break the binary contract). Please make clear any assumptions or trade-offs that you have made.
